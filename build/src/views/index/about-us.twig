							The story began two years ago, when Katya, on her way home, could not pass "Korsa", this is our first dog, she took her home as an adult, 5-6 years old.
																																																	Then the OLX helped, We took animals from the street for a while until someone wrote or called.
						</p>
						<p>
							So we got 3 dogs, 2 cats. When the apartment became too small, We started looking for a bigger place, because there were already 5 dogs.
																																										When "Alaska" was given away, we met —Åynologist Oleksyi and his wife Lesya, she is a veterinarian, now she takes care of our dogs and cats
						</p>
						<p>
							This is a story BEFORE the war
																												Because for us, life is divided into Before and After
						</p>
						<p>
							We lived in Mykolaiv...
						</p>
						<p>
							Like many other people and animals - we have suffered. We lost our shelter and lost our home. Now we start all over again.
																					But we decided to ask for help abroad.
																					I hope this site and Facebook ads will help our animals.
